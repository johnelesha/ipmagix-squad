Purpose: Store uncompiled static resources that will be processed by Nuxt’s build system (Vite/Webpack).

Files here get compiled, optimized, and hashed.

Common contents:

    CSS / SCSS → assets/css/main.css
    Sass/Less variables and mixins
    Images that you want to process (e.g., .png, .jpg, .svg)
    Fonts (.woff, .ttf)

Access in code:
        <img src="@/assets/images/logo.png" />
