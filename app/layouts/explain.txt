layout is a reusable wrapper for pages — it defines the overall structure of the page
(header, footer, sidebar, etc.) so you don’t have to repeat it in every .vue file.

Think of layouts as templates for your pages.

How layouts work

    Stored in the layouts/ directory.
    By default, Nuxt uses layouts/default.vue for all pages unless you specify a different one.
    You can create multiple layouts (e.g., default, admin, auth) and assign them per page.
