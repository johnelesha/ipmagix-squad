middleware is code that runs before a page or group of pages is rendered, allowing you to control access,
redirect users, or run logic before the component loads.

It’s like a “checkpoint” between the user navigating to a route and the page actually rendering.

How middleware works

    Runs on the server for SSR requests and on the client for client-side navigation.
    Can be applied globally or per page.

    Useful for:

        Authentication checks (redirect if not logged in)
        Role-based access control
        Redirecting based on device type, locale, or query params
        Running pre-fetch logic
